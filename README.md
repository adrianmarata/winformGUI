# Simple Project GUI using Windows Form Application (C#)

It is an application that asks you to enter your details and will eventually pop up a notification with all the details that you input earlier.

## FEATURES

The button won't push through if the details are incomplete and the application will notify you if it has a missing data. 
Once button event is done, the main form will clear/refresh all the data.
